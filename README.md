# Wine Quality Prediction with GUI

This project is designed to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. It leverages a machine learning model to make predictions and provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to input data and view results.

## Project Overview

Wine quality is an important factor for producers, retailers, and consumers alike. By analyzing the chemical properties of wine, it's possible to predict its quality, which can help in quality control, pricing, and marketing decisions. This project utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of wine samples, each with several chemical features such as acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content, to predict the quality of the wine on a scale.

### Key Components

1. **Machine Learning Model**:
    - The model is trained on a dataset of wine samples, where each sample has several chemical properties.
    - These properties are used as input features for the model, which then predicts the wine's quality.
    - Common algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Logistic Regression might be used for prediction (you can specify which one you used).

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
    - The GUI is built using `tkinter`, a standard Python library for creating graphical interfaces.
    - Users can enter the values for various chemical properties of the wine.
    - Once the data is entered, users can click a "Predict" button to see the quality prediction.

3. **User Interaction**:
    - The GUI allows users to easily interact with the prediction model without needing to write code or understand the underlying machine learning techniques.
    - This makes the tool accessible to a broader audience, including those in the wine industry who may not have a technical background.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The project also requires several Python libraries, which can be installed using pip.

### Required Libraries

You need the following libraries to run the project:

- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface.
- `scikit-learn`: For the machine learning model.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tkinter scikit-learn pandas numpy
